    "This Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and markdown cells to display your answers to the problems.  \n",
    "* Like the lab, your coding work will be developed in the accompanying `projectXX.py` file, that will be imported into the current notebook. This code will be autograded.\n",
    "* The project also has free response questions. To answer the free response questions, edit the markdown cell where specified (as in DSC 10). Submission of the project include uploading a pdf of this notebook to gradescope for manual grading.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not change the function names in the `*.py` file**\n",
    "- The functions in the `*.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. The dictionary at the end of the file (`GRADED FUNCTIONS`) contains the \"grading list\". The final function in the file allows your doctests to check that all the necessary functions exist.\n",
    "- If you changed something you weren't supposed to, just use git to revert!\n",

    "- Do not change the docstrings in the functions. These are there to tell you if your work is on the right track!\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional functions to solve the HW! \n",
    "    - Developing in python usually consists of larger files, with many short functions.\n",
    "    - You may write your other functions in an additional `.py` file that you import in `projectXX.py` (much like we do in the notebook).\n",
    "- Always document your code!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips for writing the free response questions**:\n",
    "- You should treat the notebook as a final report for the assignment, containing conclusions and answers to open ended questions that are graded.\n",
    "- Upon submitting the notebook, there should not be extraneous code in the notebook (e.g. any debugging code). You should only have your answers the the questions, and the necessary code and corresponding output data that serves as evidence for your responses.\n",
    "- Generally, the free response questions will involve you *using* the functions defined in your `.py` file to justify portions of your argument.\n",
    "- They should not be long, verbose answers! Typically a short paragraph will do.\n",

    "## Checkpoint Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "* The checkpoint requires you to turn in **questions 1-5**; \n",
    "* The checkpoint will be graded for *approximate* correctness: easier than the final tests; harder than the doctests.\n",
    "* The checkpoint will **count toward extra-credit grade** at the end of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Style Component (required)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The project will also be graded for coding style as well.\n",
    "* **Comments**: you should comment your code; the comments should explain what the code is doing (or plans to do). The comments should explain the main steps of your algorithm in plain English.\n",
    "* **Helper Functions**: You are encouraged to create other functions in the `py` file that your solutions call. You should use helper functions when:\n",
    "    - it makes your code more readable,\n",
    "    - your code has more than 2-3 \"logical steps\" (use a helper function per step).\n",
    "    - you see an opportunity to reuse code between a number of problems (or on future assignments)"

    "**Question 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "The flights dataset for 2015 is not small (~600MB). While you could likely load the entire dataset into Pandas on your laptop, if you wanted to work with more than one year, this would quickly become difficult (the data is available for 1987-2018). Therefore, we will filter down the dataset into two smaller files without ever reading the larger dataset fully into memory. We are going to create two smaller datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All flights arriving or departing from San Diego Airport in 2015.\n",
    "2. All flights flown by either JetBlue or Southwest Airline in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you are going to use the `chunksize=N` keyword in Pandas `read_csv` to read the flights dataset in blocks of `N` lines. When you use this keyword argument, `pd.read_csv(fp, chunksize=N)` becomes a *iterator* that iterates through dataframes of length N until you have reached the end of the dataset. A typical pattern looks like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "L = pd.read_csv(filepath, chunksize=1000)\n",
    "for df in L:\n",
    "    process(df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where each `df` is a dataframe of length 1000. \n",
    "\n",
    "The processing you are going to do is:\n",
    "1. Iterate through the dataset, chunk-by-chunk,\n",
    "2. Filtering out rows of each chunk\n",
    "3. Incrementally add to a filtered csv file (since the data is perhaps too big to keep in memory). Keep in mind, if you want to keep writing to the same file, the mode='a' keyword in the `.to_csv` method can be helpful when calling it in the loop (a stands for 'append')\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Write two functions that create the datasets below, using the 'chunking' pattern described above. Your functions should use `chunksize` of 10000.\n",
    "1. `get_san` which takes in a filepath containing all flights and an filepath where filtered dataset #1 is written. The function should return `None`.\n",
    "1. `get_jb_sw` which takes in a filepath containing all flights and an filepath where filtered dataset #2 is written. The function should return `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 1*: Gradescope autograding servers are quite small and can't load this dataset into memory -- so your code that reads in the large `flights.csv` dataset *must* work with chunks of the dataset one at a time to pass!\n",
